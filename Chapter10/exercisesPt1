#rough drafts for now

#problem 1
def backupProgram():
	userInput = input("Please specify a file: ")
	with open(userInput, 'r') as inputFile:
		contents = inputFile.read()
	outputFileName = userInput + ".bak"
	with open(outputfilename, 'w') as outputFile:
		outputFile.write(contents)

#problem 2
with open('alkaline_metals.txt', 'r') as inputFile:
  elName = []
  atNum = []
  atweight = []
  for line in inputFile:
    bufferLine = line.split()
     elName.append(bufferLine[0])
    atNum.append(bufferLine[1])
     atWeight.append(bufferLine[2])
  listOfLists = [elName, atNum, atWeight]

#problem 3
#"my first instinct is to try using negative indecies. Something like file.read(-1)"
#"if that doesn't work, I could just read the file forwards, then reverse the contents manually with string.reverse()"
#"python doccumentation says that 'string.reverse()' doesn't exist. Instead Python has this: string[::-1]"
